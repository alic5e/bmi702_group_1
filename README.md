## IDEAS
1. Build and compare machine learning models that predict short-term clinical deterioration (e.g., mortality within next 12–24 hours) using longitudinal ICU data.
2. Ming: AI Clinical Trial Matching & Simulation - Clinical trial enrollment is inefficient because eligibility criteria are complex, clinicians lack time to screen patients, and current tools rarely estimate whether a patient is likely to benefit or experience harm. We can build a multimodal AI system that not only matches patients to trials but also simulates expected outcomes, risks, and uncertainties to support informed and personalized decisions.
